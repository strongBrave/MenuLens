# Learnings
- The landing page uses Next.js with Tailwind CSS.
- `lucide-react` is used for icons.
- The build process (`npm run build`) is a reliable way to verify component changes in this environment.

# Decisions
- Inferred feature descriptions from the project README and context since they weren't explicitly provided in the plan details for every item.
- Used `md:grid-cols-2` for tablet size to ensure a balanced 2x2 grid before switching to 4 columns on large screens.
